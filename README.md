Bring back old DOS memories with a collection of text based <br>
casino games running through the Windows Command Prompt Console.<br>
<br>

<ul>
  <li>
    BlackJack<br>
    
    Reccomended to use Windows 10 though they should work at least as <br>
    far back as Windows 7.<br>
    <br>
    An .exe file is already included in Console/Blackjack/Version 1.2/
    For the most simple setup simply download the .zip file and copy<br>
    BlackJack.exe to your hardrive (your desktop may be best) <br>
    <br>
    When first opening the file
