Bring back old DOS memories with a collection of text based <br>
casino games running through the Windows Command Prompt Console.<br>

    BlackJack<br>
    *note that this is not yet completed
    
    Recommended to use Windows 10 though my applications should work at 
    least as far back as Windows 7.
    
    An .exe file is already included in "Console/Blackjack/Version 1.2/"
    For the most simple setup simply download the .zip file and copy
    BlackJack.exe to your hardrive (your desktop may be best) 
    
    When opening the application you will be greated with a login menu.
    Type "_new" to be walked through creating a new profile, which will
    be saved in the directory "./BJ_Profiles/". If no directory exist
    with this name one will be created.
    
    If you have any suggestions, ideas, or feedback, feel free to open
    an issue or create a pull request. Thank you!
